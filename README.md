# stats.hpdp.org

This site contains the results of the [Harold Park Displaced Persons](https://www.hpdp.org/) pool
competition. It was originally [written in Cold Fusion](https://github.com/henare/stats.hpdp.org.au/commit/4864d2d485c919fde20cad11540b68ad43d0f413)
with a MySQL backend that had [the results of every game](https://github.com/henare/stats.hpdp.org.au/commit/625c7fddc54784bc48df5a9a99f10ad581c827f9)
in the pool comp, including the Nick Power Cup.

This was difficult to maintain and host so it was converted into a Jekyll site
hosted on Netlify. In this migration we focused on getting the NPC working
first as this is the only part of the HPDP pool comp that still operates. All
the historical data for the all the weeks are there but we haven't migrated
them.
